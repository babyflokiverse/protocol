# Innovation

Innovative?

When blockchains were first being built, they were envisioned as being able to provide a ‘one size fits all’ solution, meaning that all transactions, smart contracts, or anything else is performed on a single chain. However, it’s clear now that such a system isn’t so practical, especially when there are scalability limits and innovation constraints.



Cross-chain interaction can be divided into isomorphic cross-chains and heterogeneous cross-chains according to the different underlying technology. For isomorphic chains, the security mechanism, consensus algorithm, network topology, and block generation verification logic are consistent and the cross-chain interaction between them is relatively simple... What we plan is the same yet better..
